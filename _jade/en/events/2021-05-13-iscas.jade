                h3 Event Description
                p <a href="https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/help/en/" target="_blank">Summer 2021 of Open Source Promotion Plan</a> is a summer program for college students jointly organized by Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences and openEuler community. It aims to encourage college students to actively participate in the development and maintenance of open source software and promote the vigorous development of excellent open source software community.
                p The organizer will fund projects with student applications, and the corresponding pre-tax prizes are high (RMB 12,000), medium (RMB 9,000), and low (RMB 6,000) depending on the difficulty (note: the prize amounts are pre-tax RMB amounts). Please refer to the official instructions of the Open Source Software Supply Chain Illumination Program for details.
                p The community needs to designate a community mentor for each project, in the process, you can have a better understanding of the Apache ECharts project development with the help of the mentor.

The project currently has limited functionality and would like to enhance Markdown-related features.

                        td The Apache ECharts theme river is currently drawn using a symmetric drawing method (the overall pattern is symmetric along the x-axis), and it is hoped that the wiggle algorithm will enable an asymmetric drawing to increase the viewability of the river map.

                        td Extend the overlap anti-overlap of labels
                        td High
                        td Apache ECharts now provides an anti-overlap layout algorithm for labels on some specific graphs such as pie charts. Now we hope to add a more general layout algorithm, which can search for a better position by iteratively searching for the positions where labels can be placed, and solve the label overlap problem when there are more data in the scatterplots and other graphs. You can refer to the existing papers and implementations: 1.

                        td High
                        td NAt present, the axis of Apache ECharts can only hide some of the overlapping labels when there are too many labels, but in some scenarios, the labels can be displayed staggered up and down without hiding them, so I would like to add a configuration that allows the user to intelligently move the overlapping labels up/down (or left/right in the case of the Y-axis).
                        td Add an option to enable alternate display of axis labels when turned on
